In addition, EVRAZ recommends avoiding the use of a drive \r\nnubbin since they have been shown to cause damage to the coupling. \r\n \r\nRemove pin end protectors at the last possible moment to prevent thread damage and never \r\nremove pin protectors prior to moving pipe to the rig floor \r\n \r\nPrior to making up the first connection, true vertical alignment of the rig must be checked. \r\nMisalignment in excess of 1 pipe diameter must be corrected prior to engagement and \r\nmakeup. \r\nFor Tong Operation \r\n\uf0b7 The tongs should not exceed 20 RPM while running in, and the speed should be\r\nreduced to 7 to 8 RPM for the last turn.",

Stabbing should be done carefully to avoid pin \r\nnose damage. It is also very important that reasonable vertical alignment be maintained during \r\nmake up.\r\n\uf0b7 To avoid contamination inside of the coupling, the stump should be covered while the \r\ntower pipe is being moved into position. \r\n\uf0b7 Pipe should be vertical and spin freely during make-up. Elevators should not interfere\r\nwith this process.\r\n\uf0b7 In the case of a miss stab where there is pin face and box contact, lift the joint and \r\ninspect the pin face. \r\nTorque Limits \r\n\uf0b7 Please refer to EVRlock.com for recommended torque values.\r\n\uf0b7 Torque monitoring is not required to run this connection. If torque monitoring is used\r\nplease contact EVRAZ technical services for details.\r\n\uf0b7 Following each make up, lower the joint down the hole at a modest speed before\r\nengaging the slips.\r\n\uf0b7 Place the stabbing guide on the coupling and repeat the running process.\r\nFor Top Drive Operation with drive nubbin: after each make-up visually inspect nubbin threads\r\nfor damage. After approximately 6 make ups wash the nubbin with solvent and wipe dry for a\r\nthorough inspection. Repair if required and return the nubbin to the cat walk.\r\n5.0 POST JOB \r\n\uf0b7 All unserviceable and laid down joints must be painted red on the end which was\r\ndamaged and clearly identified on the pipe body as to the reason for rejection.\r\n\uf0b7 All unused connections following the job, including all accessories, must have storage\r\ncompound applied and thread protectors firmly installed. This includes damaged\r\nconnections. Damage may be minimal and thus repairable.\r\nThread Protectors \r\n\uf0b7 EVRlock QB1-HT thread protectors are recyclable. All thread protectors are to be\r\ncollected and returned for recycling. To coordinate pick up from your rig location please\r\ncontact your local approved protector recycler to arrange for provision of protector\r\ntransportation bags and collection of the protectors.\r\nRevision History \r\nRevision Date Details",

Please refer to the \"EVRlock QB2 \r\nTorque Limits and Torque Monitoring Guidelines\", (Appendix A), for make-up torque \r\nvalues and other make up tolerances. \r\n\uf0b7 On a typical QB2 make-up chart, (Appendix B), the torque builds initially with thread \r\ninterference and then as the seal engages. This is followed by a sharp increase in \r\ntorque as the connection shoulders. If a proper shoulder has been achieved, the sharp \r\nrise in torque will take place with virtually no rotation. The shoulder torque must be \r\nchecked to determine if the connection has shouldered within the allowable torque \r\nlimits. \r\nFor example: the shoulder torque for 5 \u00bd\u201d x 17# EVRlock QB2 must be greater than 1,000 \r\nft-Ibs but less than 3,375 ft-Ibs (75% of the optimum make-up torque of 4,500 ft-Ibs). \r\n\uf0b7 If the make-up chart displays a rounded curve that displays no shoulder identification \r\n(Figure A, Appendix B), it is then recommended that the connection be laid down. \r\n\uf0b7 If the connection shoulders above the maximum shoulder rating, then it is \r\nrecommended that the connection be backed out entirely. Both the coupling and the \r\npin end should be cleaned thoroughly, wiped dry, and inspected for damage. If no \r\ndamage has occurred, re-make the connection as outlined above. If the threads or \r\neither of the pin or coupling seals have been damaged the joint or joints should be laid \r\ndown. Should several joints exhibit high shoulder torques, high shoulder torque \r\nthreshold and optimal final torque may be increased in 5% increments to a maximum of \r\n10% above the value specified at EVRlock.com for the remainder of the job or until such \r\ntime as a pattern of normal shoulder torques is achieved.\r\n\uf0b7 Following each make-up, lower the joint down the hole at a modest speed before \r\nengaging the slips. \r\n\uf0b7 Place the stabbing guide on the coupling and repeat the running process. \r\n \r\nFor Top Drive Operation with drive nubbin: after each make-up visually inspect nubbin threads \r\nfor damage. After approximately 6 make-ups, wash the nubbin with solvent and wipe dry for a \r\nthorough inspection. Repair if required and return the nubbin to the cat walk.\r\n \r\n \r\n5.0 POST JOB \r\n\uf0b7 All unserviceable and laid down joints must be painted red on the end which was \r\ndamaged and clearly identified on the pipe body as to the reason for rejection.",

The goal was \r\nto create a connection that would provide high strength and a gas tight seal for the emerging \r\nin-situ oil sands industry in western Canada. \r\nIn 2000, the 177.8 mm OD, 34.23 kg/m (7\u201d OD, 23 lbs/ft) Grade L80 QB2 successfully met \r\nrequirements equivalent to an ASL 325 ISO/PAS 12835 (TWCCEP, Thermal Well Casing \r\nConnection Evaluation Protocol) evaluation. This confirmed the QB2 as one of the first \r\npremium connections to reliably meet the minimal seepage rates required for thermal wells.\r\nIn 2012, EVRAZ again led the industry when the EVRlock QB2 was the first premium connection \r\nto successfully complete an open evaluation to the ISO/PAS 12835 (TWCCEP) standard. In \r\nthis program, a 244.5 mm, 59.53 kg/m (9-5/8\u201d OD, 40 lbs/ft) Grade L80 QB2 connection was \r\ntested to an ISO/PAS 12835 ASL of 290 and achieved average seepage rates two orders of \r\nmagnitude lower than the protocol\u2019s thresholds.\r\nAs well as formal qualification, EVRAZ has worked closely with its customers to test the EVRlock \r\nQB2 physically and with finite element modeling to understand the connection\u2019s performance \r\nin bending scenarios beyond conventional testing.\r\nEVRAZ believes strongly in transparent communication of its EVRlock QB2 testing, and full \r\nreports are available for customer review. Due to the volumes of data available the time to \r\nperform such a review would be considerable, so this white paper will summarize the \r\nconnection\u2019s extensive qualification process.\r\nThermal Qualification \r\n177.8 mm OD, 34.23 kg/m (7\u201d OD, 23 lbs/ft) Grade L80 EVRlock QB2 Thermal Evaluation \r\nA formal thermal evaluation began on the EVRlock QB2 in 1996 with CFER Technologies when \r\nEVRAZ introduced the final, swaged revision to market. At the time, there were no formal \r\nprocedures to evaluate a thermal connection. EVRAZ (then IPSCO) partnered with a major \r\nthermal operator to develop an evaluation method that would not only replicate the harsh \r\noperating conditions of in-situ thermal oil extraction, but also ensure that actual connections \r\nand materials were tested to reflect the worst case combination of tolerances required in the \r\nfield. The method was also unique in that it took advantage of a relatively new technique, \r\ncomputer assisted finite element analysis, to investigate worst case scenarios prior to\r\npreparing actual test specimens.",

These similarities and the justification for why the EVRAZ \r\n177.8 mm OD (7\u201d OD) study should be accepted as a full TWCCEP evaluation are discussed in \r\nthe following paragraphs.\r\nTesting began in 1996 with a thermal evaluation of the design taking into account what affect \r\nmaterial variability, post elastic properties, and tolerance variation would have on the \r\nconnection during all aspects of the thermal cycle, including initial make up. Further \r\nevaluation continued into 1998 to include analysis of the effect of curvature loading and \r\nextended thermal cycling.\r\nFrom these evaluations, tolerances were identified for worst case performance. This analysis is \r\nanalogous to the \u201cfront end evaluation\u201d identified in ISO/PAS 12835 (TWCCEP). \r\nFor the full scale thermal evaluation, connections were machined with tolerances that \r\ndemonstrated worst case tolerances for thread and seal galling. These connections then \r\nunderwent three consecutive make and breaks. The make and breaks demonstrated that the \r\n177.8 mm OD (7\u201d OD) EVRlock QB2 can be successfully made up and broken out three \r\nsuccessive times when using QB2-50M thread dope applied per EVRAZ field procedures.\r\nFour connections were then machined with tolerances for worst case sealability. They were \r\nmade up into a continuous string for thermal testing with two of the connections undergoing \r\nmultiple makes and the remaining two connections being made up a single time. The test \r\nspecimen selection and make-up procedures are identical to those described in TWCCEP with \r\npup length and specimen orientation in the string also meeting the requirements of the \r\nprotocol.\r\nAs with a TWCCEP evaluation, the test string underwent 10 thermal cycles between 336\u00baC/14\r\nMPa and 20\u00baC/14 MPa. At the upper and lower temperatures, the string was pressurized with \r\nan inert gas and any seepage from the connection measured. Like the TWCCEP, each \r\nconnection had a gas port drilled into the dope release groove to directly measure the seal \r\neffectiveness of each side of each connection. \r\nDuring the test, the connections met current TWCCEP thresholds of < 10 ml/min average \r\nseepage under tension (cold cycle) and < 1 mm/min average seepage under compression (hot \r\ncycle).\r\nIt should be noted that finite element analysis (FEA) indicated that the EVRlock QB2 has low \r\nsensitivity to bending, therefore a physical bend test was not performed as part of the \r\nevaluation.",

For a successful TWCCEP evaluation, \r\nactivities from four different sections of the protocol must be successfully completed. These \r\nfour sections are discussed below. As with the 177.8 mm OD (7\u201d OD) evaluation, FEA analysis \r\ndetermined that the EVRlock QB2 has low sensitivity to bending, and thus the optional bend \r\ntest was not included as part of the evaluation.\r\nFront End Evaluation/Material Characterization \r\nFEA evaluation determined that mechanical property variation of API Grade L80 casing has \r\nlittle effect on the performance of the EVRlock QB2 connection. For the purposes of the \r\nevaluation, pin material was restricted to material with yield strength in the lower 50% of the \r\nrange allowed by API (80ksi-87.5ksi). Coupling material was not restricted as it was shown to \r\nhave no effect on performance.\r\nThe front end evaluation identified the same test specimen configuration as the original 177.8\r\nmm OD (7\u201d OD) evaluation. Test specimens were manufactured with tolerances that gave the \r\nconnection the following conditions: worst case galling in the threads, worst case galling in the \r\nseal, worst case sealablity in tension (cold cycle), and worst case sealability in compression \r\n(hot cycle).\r\nGalling Resistance Testing \r\nInitial galling resistance tests showed opportunities to restrict EVRlock QB2 tolerances to make \r\nit more robust during makeup. The restrictions in tolerances were adopted across the \r\nconnection\u2019s geometry range, and were incorporated into a new revision of the manufacturing \r\nspecification. Note that the restrictions do not invalidate the geometry configuration tested in \r\nthe 7\u201d OD thermal evaluation. Test specimens passed the galling resistance test with no \r\ndamage observed on either the seal or thread after three consecutive make and breaks.\r\nThermal Evaluation \r\nA four connection test string was cycled between 290\u00baC/7.3 MPa and 20\u00baC/7.3 MPa, with gas \r\nseepage measured at the hot and cold holds under pressure. As with the 177.8 mm OD (7\u201d \r\nOD) EVRlock QB2, the 244.5 mm OD (9-5/8\u201d OD) connection exhibited seepage rates well \r\nbelow 1 ml/min in the hot cycle (compression) and 10 ml/min in the cold cycle (tension).",

To ensure that the EVRlock \r\nQB2 is able to maintain integrity in these conditions, the TWCCEP states the connection should \r\nbe able to withstand 1.5% strain before losing integrity.\r\nTo evaluate the load capability, a connection used in the galling resistance tests, as well as a \r\nconnection that had been made up multiple times and used in the thermal testing, were \r\nselected to undergo axial tension to failure testing. \r\nBoth test specimens failed well past 1.5% strain with the first surpassing 4% and the second \r\nsurpassing 6% strain. Each test specimen failed in the pipe body and not the connection, \r\nproving that the EVRlock QB2 geometry results in a connection that is stronger than the pipe \r\nbody.\r\nAdditional Studies \r\nEVRAZ manufactures the EVRlock QB2 connection in a number of different sizes and grades. \r\nPerforming a full TWCCEP evaluation can be extremely costly and time consuming. \r\nConsequently, EVRAZ has worked closely with industry experts to develop numerical models \r\nthat verify the performance of each new size and grade for which the connection is \r\nmanufactured. \r\nEVRAZ also works to understand the performance of the EVRlock QB2 outside of conventional \r\nthermal applications.

Property data typical of L80 \r\nwas employed. \r\nIn general, the connections required only minimal alterations to dimensions to keep the \r\nperformance consistent with the thoroughly tested 177.8 mm (7\u201d) base case. \r\nFEA modeling was also performed to evaluate connection performance under external \r\npressure. It was concluded that larger connections are less resistant to external pressures. The \r\nFEA was also used to determine the torque range for make-up specifications and identified \r\nsome inconsistencies between the FEA results and the factor employed by EVRAZ to scale the \r\ntorque to other connection sizes.",

Tolerances specified \r\nwere those from drawing \u201cQB2-92-100 Rev. 8.\u201d \r\nThe results demonstrate a substantial reduction in primary metal-to-metal seal contact strain in \r\nthe primary seal region. In general, the larger diameter (298.5 mm) EVRlock QB2 connection \r\ndemonstrated increased sealing contact intensity. While reduced compared to L80 products, \r\nsignificant seal contact intensity was retained at the primary radial metal-to-metal seal for both \r\nK55 connections throughout the course of three thermal cycles.\r\n298.5 mm, 89.5 kg/m (11-\u00be\u201d OD, 60 lbs/ft) L80 EVRlock QB2 Connection Analysis for \r\nThermal Operation (Noetic, 2007) \r\nFEA analysis was conducted on 298.5 mm, 89.5 kg/m (11-\u00be\u201dOD, 60 lbs/ft) L80 using SAGD \r\noperating conditions of 210\u00baC and 280\u00baC. After analysis of the effects of machining tolerances \r\non seal contact intensity, the geometry providing the worst sealing was employed to evaluate \r\nthe connection in a thermal environment. It was demonstrated that torque shoulder contact \r\ndoes not provide an effective seal. However, the primary radial metal to metal seal maintained \r\n68% of its make-up seal intensity in the most extreme SAGD load path. Comparing the results \r\nto similar results for K55 material shows that the higher yield strength of L80 results in a \r\nsignificant increase in the primary radial seal contact intensity. \r\nLarge Diameter EVRlock QB2 Development Make and Break Summary Report (EVRAZ, 2008) \r\nA pre-production make and break analysis of the 298.5 mm OD and 339.7 mm OD (11-\u00be\u201d OD \r\nand 13-3/8\u201d OD) EVRlock QB2 connections was performed. Connections underwent repeated \r\nmakes without showing galling on the seals or threads.\r\nAnalysis of 244.5 mm OD (9-5/8\u201d OD) EVRlock QB2 in Bending (EVRAZ, 2011) \r\nPrevious work identified that the EVRlock QB2 has little sensitivity to bending; however, that \r\nanalysis focused on fairly gradual builds. This study looked at the effect of increasing wall \r\nthickness on the stress in the connection under builds of 16\u00ba/20 m and 19\u00ba/20 m.",

Finally, an expected rotational life for each critical area was \r\ncalculated.\r\nFor dogleg severities of 10\u00ba/30 m and less, thread 11 (the fifth-to-last engaged thread) was \r\nidentified as having the greatest stress concentration during bending rotation and was \r\npredicted to have a failure life greater than 10,000 rotations. At dogleg severities greater than \r\n10\u00ba/30 m, the life is significantly reduced, eventually dropping below 5,000 cycles at \r\napproximately 13\u00ba/30 m.\r\nWhen applying this data to practice, it should be noted that these numbers are theoretical; \r\ntherefore, when planning rotational life of a connection a significant safety factor should be \r\nconsidered. In addition, although the model takes into account both low cycle and high cycle \r\nfatigue damage, the model can show sensitivity to cycle speed in cases of large dogleg \r\nseverities where the fatigue life of the connection is significantly lowered.\r\nSummary \r\nWith its introduction in the mid-1990s, EVRlock QB2 has proven to be an industry leader in \r\nperformance. Since then, EVRAZ has continued to analyze and improve the connection, taking \r\nadvantage of new manufacturing techniques and exploring new applications with its customers \r\nto ensure that after 20 years of reliable field service, the connection will continue to provide \r\nsuperior performance for years to come.",

Do not unload pipe with end hooks. \r\n \r\n \r\n2.0 INSPECTION AND PREPARATION \r\n \r\n\u2022 Ensure that the drive nubbins, float equipment, thread compound, thread lock, stabbing \r\nguides, drifts, snakes and any other required accessories are on location. Visually \r\ninspect to ensure that all accessories are in good condition. \r\n\u2022 Adequate space must be given on the pipe racks for cleaning and visual inspection, if \r\nrequired. \r\n\u2022 Remove both thread protectors from each joint on the pipe racks and full length drift \r\neach joint prior to running in the hole. Use an appropriately sized Teflon or nylon drift \r\nand snake. All no-drifts should be clearly identified on the pipe and set aside. \r\n\u2022 A visual verification of the mill end make-up position should be performed on several \r\nmill ends to verify the coupling has not rotated during handling and transportation. To \r\nhelp in determining this, the end of pin to coupling face distance on the mill end should \r\nbe equivalent to the makeup loss (table 1) +0.15\u201d/-0.1\u201d. This should be measured with \r\na t-bar caliper to ensure that you are measuring parallel to the pipe axis and not with a \r\nruler.\r\n\u2022 Pin end thread protectors must be replaced prior to moving pipe and should be free \r\nfrom contamination.\r\n \r\n3.0 EQUIPMENT\r\n \r\nTop Drive Rigs \r\n\u2022 When not using bales and elevators, EVRAZ recommends the use of a casing running \r\ntool as opposed to a drive nubbin. Use of a casing running tool eliminates the possibility\r\nfor damage to the coupling threads due to excessive interference. \r\n\u2022 If a drive nubbin is used, it should be inspected before use to ensure it is in good \r\ncondition. Additional inspections should be performed after every six make-up/break \r\nout cycles.",

These connections may be identi\u0002fied by a stencil adjacent to the mill end that reads:\r\nPipe Diameter Cleanup \r\nEVRAZ Field Bulletin 001-13 \r\nPrior to cutting the QB2 thread form and seal, the pipe outer diameter will be machined to nominal for a \r\nlength equal to the make-up loss, with a tolerance of + 0.2\u201d. As a result, a ring of machined pipe will be \r\nvisible past the coupling when the connection is made up, up to 0.2\u201d in length.\r\nThe following picture is an example of a seamless QB2 pin end with outer diameter turned. Aside from \r\nthe stenciling, the new connection is easily identified as there are no longer black crested threads in the \r\nthread runout (mill scale on runout thread crests). That being said, there still may be localized areas on \r\nthe circumference in the thread runout where the outer diameter did not turn off; this is perfectly ac\u0002ceptable. \r\nFigure 1, Example of an EVRAZ QB2 Connection \r\nThat has had the Diameter Machined \r\nFor more information please contact the Calgary sales office: 403 543-8000",

Thread Phase Engagement \r\nWe have occasionally received reports of thread galling on EVRlock QB2, \r\nwhich has the same thread form as EVRlock QB1-HT, during make-up. The \r\nrandom occurrence of this condition may be related to how the threads align \r\nand mate during stabbing. It is surmised that a few thread crests are \r\ndisplaced and damaged when they are coincidently aligned at an \r\nundetermined engagement phase position. This trial was performed to \r\ndetermine the validity of this hypothesis. \r\nWe first attempted to determine the position of minimum flank contact prior to \r\nstarting by referencing the EVRlock QB1-HT drawing. If this was not \r\npossible, we determined the position by aligning the starting point of the pin \r\nand coupling threads, then continued to work around the circumference. \r\nProtocol was: \r\n1. Stab the connection in a \u201cnormal manner\u201d \r\n2. Lift out pin and inspect for damage \r\n3. Repeat 1 and 2 again (if no damage, rotate 1/8 turn and repeat \r\nuntil 360\u00b0 was tested)",

They were subjected to \r\nthermal compression at ~350\u00baC until failure.\r\nScope and Objectives \r\nThis trial was conducted to compare the performance of QB1-HT to the API Buttress under \r\nthermally-induced compression. The main objectives were:\r\n\uf0b7 To test the thermal compression limit of QB1-HT and API Buttress under high \r\ntemperature and strain conditions\r\n\uf0b7 To compare the actual strength of QB1-HT to an API Buttress connection of similar \r\ngrade, size, and weight\r\n\uf0b7 To demonstrate that QB1-HT is superior to the API Buttress and the L80 pipe body\r\nMaterials and Methods \r\n \r\nA total of four connections were tested: two EVRlock QB1-HT semi-premium connections and\r\ntwo API Buttresses. Connections were machined on standard EVRAZ ERW 7\u201d OD 26# Grade \r\nL80 Casing produced at EVRAZ Calgary. To reduce stress concentration from end effects,\r\ncasing was machined to a final minimum length of 33.1\u201d. All connections were made up as\r\ndefined by the EVRAZ EVRlock QB1-HT running procedures and API 5C1.\r\nFigure 1 illustrates the setup for all four experiments. Test specimens were welded into a\r\ntwo million pound test frame and a Miller ProHeat induction unit was used to achieve the\r\ndesired final temperature. As shown in the Figure 1, temperature was monitored by\r\nthermocouples at five locations, with locations 2 and 3 acting as control points for the\r\nMiller ProHeat unit. Strain was measured locally by both linear variable displacement\r\ntransducers [LVDTs] and extensometers placed above and below the connection.\r\nPrior to testing, each test specimen was cycled between +/- 20,000lbs (~2.5 ksi) of force at \r\nroom temperature. This was achieved using the test frame\u2019s load cylinder acting in position \r\ncontrol. This verified the operation of the extensometers and was considered to have a \r\nnegligible effect on the final performance of the test specimen. After mechanically cycling,\r\nthe load was brought back to zero and the cross-head and actuator locked before specimen \r\nheating. All thermal expansion and the strain generated in the test string is constrained by\r\nthe test frame. Heating began from room temperature and continued at a rate of 1\u00b0C /\r\nminute until 350\u00b0C. Upon reaching the final maximum temperature, the heating was\r\nadjusted to ensure that the test specimen was held at a constant temperature. In all four\r\ntest specimens, the load in the test frame dropped significantly once the test string reached",

At this point, a mechanical strain was applied to the test frame to\r\nexaggerate the location and mode of failure.\r\nResults \r\n \r\nTemperature at Failure\r\nTable 1 compares the peak loads to temperatures at different specimen locations. Due to \r\nreduced yield strength with increasing temperatures, plastic deformation is expected to \r\noccur at locations with the highest temperature readings. When specimens are compressed, \r\nthe casing will attempt to equalize load by shedding strain into weaker locations. As a result, \r\nlocations of higher temperature fail due to lower resistance to strain. Of the four trials, two \r\nresults were inconsistent with these hypotheses: the QB1-HT (1) and API Buttress (2). The \r\nresulting locations of failure for all trials, with respect to temperature, are presented in \r\nFigure 2.\r\nIn the case of the QB1-HT, failure occurred on the pipe body rather than the connection. \r\nSince the casing and connection are composed of the same material, the ability of the QB1-\r\nHT to withstand failure at higher temperatures, and lower yield strength, demonstrates a \r\nstronger structural geometry. The design of the QB1-HT ensured that stresses were localized \r\non the pipe body; therefore, failure was prevented at the connection despite the weakened \r\nmaterial.\r\nThe opposite is true for the API Buttress, with failure occurring on the connection rather \r\nthan the upper pipe body. Given that failure occurred at the location of higher strain \r\nresistance, it is indicative that stresses localized in the Buttress connection. Therefore, \r\nwhile the actual strength of the QB1-HT is inconclusive, it is suggested to be greater than \r\nthe L80 casing and API Buttress due to a more optimized geometry.\r\n \r\nFailure Geometry\r\nVisual examination showed a difference in the geometry of the deformations. Based on the \r\ngeneral shape, it is noted that both QB1-HT specimens failed symmetrically as opposed to\r\nthe API Buttress, which had a \u201ckink\u201d in the connection.\r\nThe failure geometry of the QB1-HT specimens is a \u201crolled-over\u201d structure as seen in Figures\r\n3 and 4. Uniform axial collapse suggests that failure occurred as a result of high strain, but\r\nwith even stress distribution. Moreover, results agree with Euler\u2019s hypothesized behavior for a \r\ncolumn with both ends fixed. While API Buttress (1) also had a rolled structure above the \r\nconnection, there was an evident lack of symmetry overall which suggests failure at a point.",

    "content": "3 / 13\r\nSections were taken from locations of plastic deformation to ensure that failures were not \r\ncaused by defects. A total of four sections were analyzed from each specimen; these consisted \r\nof one along the weld and at 90, 180, and 270 degrees respectively.\r\nWhen comparing the failed sections near the connection, both API Buttresses showed signs of \r\ndeflection. As seen in both Figure 5 and Figure 6, the API Buttress appears to angle slightly \r\nwhen compared to the QB1-HT in Figure 4. Closer inspection also reveals that deflection \r\nbecomes increasingly evident along the last few threads. Based on this observation it is \r\npossible that the point of failure, noted from the geometric comparison, initiated from the \r\nconnection on the last engaged thread.\r\nGraphical Analysis\r\nTo further understand the deformation, particularly with API Buttress (2), stress strain\r\ngraphs were analyzed. An analysis of QB1-HT (1) is shown in Figure 7 and graphs for all trials\r\ncan be seen in Figures 8 and 9.\r\nTable 2 summarizes the values of strain at failure- determined from the graphs. Since the \r\nspecimens are under compression, greater negative strain corresponds to greater plastic \r\ndeformation. With the API Buttress (2), the strain for both top and bottom coincide,\r\nindicating deformation occurring at both locations. In contrast, there is an inclination for\r\ndeformation at either the top or bottom for the remaining specimens.\r\nWhen comparing specific values of stress and strain at failure, an anomaly was observed in \r\nresults for API Buttress (2). While both the QB1-HT and Buttress (1) failed elastically (<0.05% \r\nstrain), Buttress (2) failed in the elastic/plastic transition zone of ~0.5% strain. This disparity\r\nis most likely due to discrepancy in test setup. As noted in Table 1, API Buttress (2) had\r\nissues in maintaining a consistent temperature across the test string, with a temperature\r\ndifference of ~100\u00b0C between the top and the remaining points. Aside from this variance,\r\nthe remaining tests agree with expectations, with both QB1-HT test strings surpassing the API\r\nButtress (1) in strain and stress capacity at failure.\r\nStress was also plotted relative to temperature and compared to a previous high temperature \r\ncharacterization of EVRAZ standard Grade L80 casing by Noetic Engineering. A total of six data \r\npoints were plotted using the yield stress of the L80, and a polynomial trend line was used to \r\ndetermine theoretical stresses at corresponding temperatures of the connections. As shown in \r\nTable 3 and Figure 9, all results were relatively close to the theoretical values: QB1-HT (1) and \r\n(2) failed at 84.5% and at 87.2% of the hypothetical L80 yield strength, while AP1 Buttress\r\nfailed at 62.3% and 116.8% respectively.

The Field Bulletin is also available online at \r\nwww.evrazna.com. \r\nChanges incorporate client feedback to ensure that QB2 running procedures reflect \r\ncurrent practices in the field. Torque tables, make-up speed, and other critical data \r\nremain unchanged from previous revisions.\r\n \r\nDope Application\r\n \r\nSuccessful make-up of the QB2 connection hinges on dope application. TOPCO \r\nQB2-50M was created specifically for use with the QB2 and is essential to its perfor\u0002mance.\r\nTo ensure proper application, the following procedure should be used:\r\n- The thread compound container must remain free of all contaminants (i.e.: \r\nwater, ice, sand, solvent, sawdust, etc.) and should be thoroughly stirred prior to \r\napplication to ensure proper mixing of solid particles. \r\n- During cold weather, the thread compound should be stored inside and applied \r\nwarm, if possible. In addition, steaming of the pipe ends is recommended to \r\nfacilitate application of QB2-50M.\r\n- Apply a thin, even coat of the thread compound to the pin seal and the pin and \r\ncoupling threads. Thread compound on the coupling seal shall average two or \r\nmore times the thickness of the compound on other surfaces, while thread \r\ncompound remaining in the coupling's dope relief groove shall be minimized. A \r\nmoustache brush is recommended. A thin even coat is defined as \r\napproximately 0.030\u201d to 0.040\u201d (0.75mm to 1mm) with thread form still clearly \r\nvisible. Do not over-coat.",

Do not unload pipe with end hooks. \r\n \r\n2.0 INSPECTION AND PREPARATION \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 Ensure that the drive nubbins, float equipment, thread compound, thread lock, stabbing \r\nguides, drifts, snakes and any other required accessories are on location. Visually \r\ninspect to ensure that all accessories are in good condition. \r\n\uf0b7 Adequate space must be given on the pipe racks for cleaning and visual inspection, if \r\nrequired. \r\n\uf0b7 Remove both thread protectors from each joint on the pipe racks and full length drift \r\neach joint prior to running in the hole. Use an appropriately sized Teflon or nylon drift \r\nand snake. All no-drifts should be clearly identified on the pipe and set aside. \r\n\uf0b7 Verification of the mill end make-up should be performed on several mill ends to verify \r\nthat the coupling has not come loose during transportation. A visual inspection of the ID \r\nshould show the mill end pin engaged with the shoulder with no visible gap. Using a \r\n1/32\u201d feeler gauge, it should not be able to freely pass through the pin nose/shoulder \r\naround the circumference. Additionally the coupling should not be able to be freely \r\nmoved on the pin by hand. \r\n\uf0b7 Pin end thread protectors must be replaced prior to moving pipe and should be free \r\nfrom contamination. \r\n \r\n3.0 EQUIPMENT\r\n \r\nTop Drive Rigs \r\n\uf0b7 When not using bales and elevators, EVRAZ recommends the use of a casing running \r\ntool as opposed to a drive nubbin. Use of a casing running tool eliminates the possibility \r\nfor damage to the coupling threads due to excessive interference. \r\n\uf0b7 If a drive nubbin is used, it should be inspected before use to ensure it is in good \r\ncondition. Additional inspections should be performed after every six make-up/break \r\nout cycles. \r\n\uf0b7 Drive nubbins must not abrade or damage thread forms or phosphate coating.",

Other thread compounds may be used upon consultation with EVRAZ Technical \r\nServices. \r\no If other API 5A3 compliant thread compounds are utilized the torque correction \r\nfactor noted by the compound manufacturer must be considered \r\n\uf0b7 The thread compound container must remain free of all contaminants (i.e.: water, ice, \r\nsand, solvent, sawdust, etc.) and should be thoroughly stirred prior to application to \r\nensure proper mixing of solid particles. \r\n\uf0b7 During cold weather, the thread compound should be stored inside and applied warm, if \r\npossible. In addition, steaming of the pipe ends is recommended to facilitate \r\napplication of thread compound. \r\n\uf0b7 Apply a thin, even coat of the thread compound to the pin and coupling threads. \r\no A 4\u201d wide (100) paint brush is suitable for applying thread compound on the pin \r\nthreads. \r\no A bottle brush or a dope brush is recommended for applying thread compound \r\nto the coupling threads. \r\n\uf0b7 A thin even coat is defined as being approximately 0.030\u201d to 0.040\u201d thick (0.75 to 1) \r\nwith the buttress form still clearly visible. If an excessive amount of compound has \r\nbeen squeezed out at the power tight position reduce the amount of compound being \r\napplied to the threads. \r\n\uf0b7 The guidelines noted above are provided as a recommendation only. Other thread \r\ncompound application practices that exhibit good workmanship and that produce \r\nexpected levels of connection make-up and break-out performance may be adopted. \r\n \r\n4.0 RUNNING PROCEDURE \r\n\uf0b7 EVRAZ recommends the use of bales and elevators paired with conventional or integral \r\npower tongs to run EVRlock EB. In addition, EVRAZ recommends avoiding the use of a \r\ndrive nubbin since they have been shown to cause damage to the coupling threads.",

Please \r\nnote that this triangle is not located at the same distance from the pin nose as API \r\nbuttress but at the \u201cmake-up loss\u201d distance identified in Table 1. \r\no When making up to API Buttress accessories (such as float collars, shoes, etc) \r\nplease refer to PC-REP-008 which may be found on EVRAZNA.com \r\n \r\nFor Tong Operation \r\n\uf0b7 The tongs should not exceed 25* RPM while running in, and the speed should be \r\nreduced to 8 to 12 RPM* for the last turn. \r\n* Minor Excursions (+15%) beyond these RPM values can be tolerated on an \r\nintermittent basis, however; should more than 25% of the connections that have \r\nbeen made-up exhibit excursions be noted, the cause of variance should be \r\ndetermined. \r\nDo not shift to low gear within one thread turn of shoulder position. \r\n\uf0b7 EVRAZ recommends the use of a stabbing guide. Stabbing should be done carefully to \r\navoid pin nose damage. It is also particularly important that reasonable vertical \r\nalignment be maintained during make-up to avoid galling. \r\n\uf0b7 To avoid contamination inside of the coupling, the stump should be covered when the \r\ntower pipe is being moved into position. The cover must be removed just prior to \r\nstabbing. \r\n\uf0b7 Pipe should be vertical and spin freely during make-up. Elevators should not interfere \r\nwith this process. \r\nRunning Torque & Triangle Position \r\n\uf0b7 During initial connection make-up on the first 10 joints, the location of the face of the \r\ncoupling in relationship to the triangle must be visually verified. The nominal make-up \r\nposition at power tight should position the face of the coupling at the triangle base \r\nwhen the connection has shouldered. \r\n\uf0b7 Should coupling rotation be observed on the mill end during final power tight make-up \r\nverify the position of the coupling face relative to the mill end triangle. \r\n\uf0b7 Please refer to EVRAZNA.com for the recommended torque values for the diameter, \r\nweight, & grade being run (or refer to Section 6 of this document).",
